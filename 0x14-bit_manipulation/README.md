Welcome to C Bit Manipulation!

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. C provides operators and library functions to do this.

This repo contains code for the practice of bit manipulation in C and demonstrates how to use the operators and library functions to manipulate bits.

Bitwise Operators

C provides several bitwise operators for manipulating individual bits. These include:

The bitwise AND operator (&): This operator takes two bit patterns and performs a logical AND on each individual bit.

The bitwise OR operator (|): This operator takes two bit patterns and performs a logical OR on each individual bit.

The bitwise XOR operator (^): This operator takes two bit patterns and performs a logical XOR on each individual bit.

The bitwise NOT operator (~): This operator takes a single bit pattern and performs a logical NOT on each individual bit.

The left-shift operator (<<): This operator takes a bit pattern and shifts all of the bits to the left by a specified number of bits.

The right-shift operator (>>): This operator takes a bit pattern and shifts all of the bits to the right by a specified number



Library Functions

In addition to the bitwise operators, C provides a number of library functions for manipulating bits. These include:

The bit_set() function: This function takes a bit pattern and sets a specific bit to 1.

The bit_clear() function: This function takes a bit pattern and clears a specific bit to 0.

The bit_test() function: This function takes a bit pattern and tests a specific bit, returning 1 if the bit is set or 0 if the bit is not set.

The bit_flip() function: This function takes a bit pattern and flips a specific bit.

The bit_count() function: This function takes a bit pattern and returns the number of bits that are set.
