# Function Pointers in C

This repository contains code examples of function pointers in C. Function pointers are an essential part of C programming, and are used to pass functions as parameters or assign functions to variables. Function pointers are powerful and can be used to create generic functions and reduce code duplication. The examples in this repository are intended to use as practice the basics of function pointers and provide an understanding of how to use them effectively.
