# C Preprocessor

This repository contains the C preprocessor, a program that processes C source code before it is compiled. It is used to expand macros, include other source files, and perform various other transformations on the source code.

The C preprocessor is an important part of the C language and is used by most C compilers. The compiler usually invokes it automatically but can also be invoked manually.

This repository contains example programs for the C preprocessor, as well as some test cases.
