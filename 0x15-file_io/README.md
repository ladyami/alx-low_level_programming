File I/O in C Programming

File I/O stands for "File Input/Output" and refers to the process of reading and writing files in C programming. It allows a program to store and access data beyond the life of the program.

The C library provides a set of functions to work with files. The functions are grouped into four categories:

Opening and Closing Files: These functions include fopen(), fclose(), and freopen().

Reading and Writing: These functions are used to read from and write to files. They include fgetc(), fgets(), fputc(), fputs(), fread(), and fwrite().

Positioning: These functions are used to move the file pointer to different positions in the file. They include fseek(), ftell(), and rewind().

Error Handling: These functions are used to handle errors that may occur while working with files. They include feof(), ferror(), and clearerr().

Using File I/O functions in C programming is a straightforward process. First, you need to open a file using fopen(). Then, you can use other functions to read or write data to the file. Finally, you need to close the file using
